<p>Our project is a machine learning program that determines the amount of stress a person has from voice recordings. Our group is taking 200 voice samples per person for a total of 600 voice samples. Each time we take a voice sample, we record the date, time, stress (yes or no), and the amount of sleep we had. There are other attributes we record (such as if we drank, if we are sick, if we smoked, if we are on medicine, our blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature). We process these samples, and the computer will turn the voice samples into a variety of numbers corresponding to different parameters. We will train a machine to recognize when our teammates are stressed, and try to implement a machine learning algorithm that can categorize whether a person is stressed or unstressed from the numbers generated from the voice recognition software. Our goal at the end of the project is to have a predictive algorithm that can tell if a person is stressed or unstressed from a voice sample.  </p>

<h3>Our Voice Sampling Script</h3>

<p>Do each 3 times:<br>Hold "a" (ah) for 10 seconds.<br>Hold "i" (ee) for 10 seconds.<br>"Pea," "Tea," "Key" 10 times.<br><br>"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."<br><br>Then, speak spontaneously for 15 seconds.</p>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
