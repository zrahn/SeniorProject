<p>Our project is a machine learning program that will determine, from voice recordings, the amount of stress a person has. Our group is taking 200 voice samples per person for a total of 600 voice samples. Each time we take a voice sample, we record the date, time, stress (yes or no), and the amount of sleep we had. There are other attributes we may record (such as if we drank, if we are sick, if we smoked, if we are on medicine, our blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature). We process these samples, and the computer will turn the voice samples into a variety of numbers corresponding to different parameters. We will train a machine to recognize when our teammates are stressed, and try to implement a machine learning algorithm that can categorize whether a person is stressed or unstressed from the numbers generated from the voice recognition software. So the ultimate goal of the project is to have a predictive algorithm that can tell if a person is stressed or unstressed from a voice sample.  </p>

<h3>Our Voice Sampling Script</h3>

<p>Do each 3 times:<br>Hold "a" (ah) for 10 seconds.<br>Hold "i" (ee) for 10 seconds.<br>"Pea," "Tea," "Key" 10 times.<br><br>"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon."<br><br>Then, speak spontaneously for 15 seconds.</p>

<h3><a id="week1" class="anchor" href="#week1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 1</h3>
<p>Our team researched the topic of our project: Machine Learning. We read two research papers. The first paper, by David Cooper, analyzes audio and video samples in attempts to determine the emotion of each sample. He found that the video was able to determine the subject's emotion accurately, but the video was too complex. The second paper, by Marcil Boucher, discussed the motor speech impediments associated with autistic children. Boucher analyzed the speech samples from 15 different children using the same script numerous times. The script includes prolongation of two letters, repetition of a short phrase, reading a passage, and speaking spontaneously.</br></p>

<h3><a id="week2" class="anchor" href="#week2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 2</h3>
<p>We created our script, and used a similar script that Dr. Boucher used in her dissertation (See script above). Our team determined that we will each take 200 samples using our iPHone voice recorder throughout the semester. We also enrolled in the Stanford Machine Learning Corsera course.</br></p>
